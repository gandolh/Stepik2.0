# Stepik 2.0

A project that is still in development aims to facilitate the teaching of programming by creating courses and managing the classroom. The courses should have Chapters, and the chapters should have theory lessons, multiple-choice tests or coding tests. It will be fully implemented using .Net Core technologies. 

At the moment:
- the seeding mechanism is implemented using Dapper
- console applications running in Docker to compile C++/Python code.
- Integrated Monaco editor
- Implemented code evaluation
- Custom login/register with cookies mechanism
- Implemented pages to see courses and lessons. The lessons can include code runners and quizez.
